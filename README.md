This is my first big assignment from the "Practical Ruby on Rails Course" from Mix & Go.

# Assigment

Build a simple blog.

Add a Post model which has title and body as its fields, which allows users to create posts.

Users should be able to:

- Create posts

- List all the posts (displaying the title and author - each post should belong to a user)

- Update their own posts

- Show the details page of a specific post

If someone is not logged in, he/she can only see posts, but not edit them.

Finally, upload your code to Github, and paste the repository link here.
